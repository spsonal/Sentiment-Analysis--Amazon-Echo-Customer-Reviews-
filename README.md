# Sentiment-Analysis--Amazon-Echo-Customer-Reviews-
In this project, I have built, trained and tested an AI model to predict sentiment from real Amazon customer reviews. 
AI/Ml based sentiment analysis is crucial for companies to automatically predict whether their customers are happy or not. The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of customer reviews.
Tool- Google Colab, Python, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
DATA:
Inputs- Amazon reviews
Output- Sentiment(0 or 1)
Data Source- Kaggle
